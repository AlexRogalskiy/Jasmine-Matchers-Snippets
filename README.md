# Jasmine Matchers Snippets

Snippets to ease development with [Jasmine Matchers](https://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers).

In order to use the snippets, just enter the shortcode and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

Each snippet should be easy to remember as they follow the first and capital letters of each matcher, such as <kbd>t</kbd>`o`<kbd>h</kbd>`ave`<kbd>a</kbd>`rray`<kbd>o</kbd>`f`<kbd>b</kbd>`ooleans`.

Put an <kbd>n</kbd> at the beginning for `.not` cases;

+ <kbd>t</kbd><kbd>b</kbd> creates `expect(instance).toBe(instance)`
+ <kbd>n</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>b</kbd> creates `expect(instance).not.toBe(instance)`

`$1`, `$2` etc shows the position where the caret will appear after you've inserted a snippet. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again will move the caret to the next `$n`.
